sesame capsules are prone to dehisce, which causes yield loss, and it is an important factor influencing mechanized harvesting. Establishment of an easy, accurate, reliable and reproducible method for identification sesame capsule dehiscence (CD) resistance, will be helpful to discover germplasm with CD resistance and breed varieties resistant to CD, consequently promote the mechanization process of sesame production.

Flower development has been the subject of intensive study for over the past 20 years. These studies led to the establishment of the well-known ABCDE model that explained the genetic regulation of floral organ identity determination. This model proposes that five classes of genes (A, B, C, D, and E) act in a combinatorial way to specify the distinct floral organs (Theissen and Saedler, 2001). The A+E protein complex determines sepals, the A+B+E complex specifies petals, the B+C+E complex specifies stamens, the C+E complex specifies carpels and the D+E complex determines the ovules (Colombo et al., 1995; Theissen and Saedler, 2001). In Arabidopsis, the class A genes are APETALA1/2 (AP1/2) (Mandel et al., 1992; Jofuku et al., 1994); the class B genes are AP3 (Jack et al., 1992) and PISTILLATA (PI) (Goto and Meyerowitz, 1994); the class C gene is AGAMOUS (AG) (Yanofsky et al., 1990); the class D genes are SEEDSTICK (STK) and SHATTERPROOF1/2 (SHP1/2) (Favaro et al., 2003); and the class E genes are SEPALLATA1/2/3/4 (SEP1/2/3/4) (Pelaz et al., 2000).

Construction of RNAi cassette
A 470-bp fragment of the BnSHP1 cDNA (Accession, AY036062) without MADS-box region was amplified by PCR using specific primers; F: 5′-ATACTAGTGGCGCGCCCCGTTAACCCTCCACTG-3′ and R: 5′-GCCTTAATTAAATTTAAATTTGAAGAGGAGGTTGGTC-3′ containing restriction enzyme digestion sites for Asc1, Aws1, Spe1 and Pac1 (underlined), for cloning the sense and antisense fragments in the above sites in pGSA1252 behind the CaMV35S promoter. The RNAi cassette was removed with Pst1 digestion and sub-cloned in the Pst1 site in pCAMBIA3301 to make pCAMRNAi.
